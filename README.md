Czech Diacritic Keyboard 
========================

This is a modified AOSP keyboard, that features iPhone-like writing of diacritics. Caron an acute keys are added to the right of
the keyboard for faster typing. The diacritic keys best fit Czech language, but are suitable for any language that uses them.
Unfortunately auto-correction is broken and I am unable to fix (I tried. A lot).

As a bonus I also added swipe control, that allows you to precisely navigate throughout the text.

Main features:

* Caron and acute keys for faster typing
* Suitable for any language, that uses diacritics (Czech, Slovak, ...)
* Precise navigation in text by swiping across the keyboard
* Material design

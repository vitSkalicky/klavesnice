This is modified AOSP keyboard, which features iPhone-like writing of diacritics. Caron an acute keys are added to the right of the keyboard for faster typing. The diacritic keys best fit Czech language, but are suitable for any language that uses them.
Unfortunately, auto-correction is broken, and I am unable to fix it (I tried. A lot).

As a bonus I also added 'swipe control', which allows you to precisely navigate throughout the text.

Main features:

* Caron and acute keys for faster typing
* Suitable for any language that uses diacritics (Czech, Slovak, ...)
* Precise navigation throughout the text by swiping across the keyboard
* Material design
